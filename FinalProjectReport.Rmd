## 1 Introduction

The Epinions dataset is a who-trust-whom online social network of a general consumer review site [Epinions.com](https://Epinions.com). Members of the site can decide whether to "trust" each other. The network consists of 75879 nodes and 508837 edges.

Analyzing this network can provide insight to the role of trust in online forums. The measurement of key metrics, such as the average degree of a given node, or the mean distance across the network, can provide insight on how users of other online forums may interact with each other. Furthermore, the visualization of this network, its communities, most central nodes, and adjacency matrix can allow us to more clearly identify trends in the network.

## 2 Methodology

The data processing involved was relatively straight forward. The edge-list for the network was downloaded from the SNAP dataset repository, and read into a DataFrame object in R. Using the `igraph` package, the data was transformed to an `igraph` object. The `igraph` package extends base R functions such as `plot` to allow for the interaction with the `igraph` object. Additionally, the package provides functions that allow for the measurement of metrics such as edge density, connectivity, etc., which will be investigated further below (\S 3).

## 3 Analysis

### 3.1 Induced Sub-Graphs: Randomly Selected Nodes

Four induced subgraphs, consisting of a random sample of 200 nodes each, are visualized below (Fig. 1). Only a small number of connections exist in each subgraph, indicating that there is weak connectivity between the nodes in each graph.

### 3.2 Network Metrics

The network has been summarized by various metrics, as displayed in the table below.

| Mean Distance | Edge Density | Reciprocity | Transitivity | Diameter | Connected Components? | Articulation Points | Modularity | 
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | 
| 4.754723      | 8.83774e-05  | 0.405226    | 0.06567883   | 16       | No, 42176 nodes unconnected  | 15936 nodes         | 0.39       |

Each metric can be described as follows:

* Density: The ratio of edges in a graph to the total number of edges in the graph.
* Reciprocity: The ratio of total number of reciprocal edges relative to the total number of edges.
* Transitivity: The tendency of nodes to cluster.
* Reachability: The aggregate version of node-level reachability; the ability of one node to reach other nodes in a directed graph.
* Diameter: The longest possible shortest path between any pair of nodes in the graph.
* Connected components: The subgraphs within the graph such that all nodes are within the subgraph are connected by a path. Separated into strongly connected components and weakly connected components.
* Articulation points: The nodes that if removed would split the graph into different component subgraphs.
* Modularity: The measure of the density of connections within a communities; the communities which are _greedily_ formed with the `cluster_fast_greedy()` algorithm, included with the `igraph` package.

### 3.3 Community Detection

As stated above, the `cluster_fast_greedy()` algorithm _greedily_ forms communities within the network and attempts to find subsequent nodes which fit into these "communities". In the Trust Network, over 3200 communities were found. The 5 largest communities had 24051, 18925, 9590, 902, and 898 nodes, respectively. This tells us that the 5 largest groups contain just under 75% of all of the nodes in the network.

In addition to community detection at the network level, ten nodes which had the highest degrees were analyzed using the `ego()` function provided by the `igraph` package. The `ego()` function finds neighborhoods of nodes, at the node level. The top nodes were separated into three groups, those with the most connections to them, those with the most connections from them, and those with the most connections overall. Additionally, it should be noted that only 1-degree of separation was considered in each of the neighborhoods.

In plotting the neighborhoods for each of these groups (\S 4), observed were different patterns in the network layout. Some neighborhoods appeared as "linear", in a straight line, and others appeared more circular. The linear neighborhoods would appear when there are two or more distinct sub-neighborhoods that are only connected through another sub-neighborhood. Conversely, circular patterns would appear when sub-neighborhoods of the network were interconnected.

### 3.4 Adjacency Matrix

Due to the size and low density of the network, any adjacency matrices produced did not provide meaningful insight to the dataset (see \S 7.2 for plot).

## 4 Results

Upon immediate inspection of the dataset, and more specifically the inspection of the induced subgraphs of randomly selected nodes, it became apparent that the network density was very low (Fig. 1).

```{r dpi=400, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Induced Sub-Graphs of the Trust Network.", echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("./images/induced_subgraphs.png")
```

However, this is not to indicate that there are not meaningful connections within the network.

```{r dpi=400, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Neighborhoods of Top both In-Degree and Out-Degree Nodes", echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
# include_graphics("./images/top_nodes.png")
```

```{r dpi=400, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Neighborhoods of Top In-Degree Nodes", echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
# include_graphics("./images/in_top_nodes.png")
```

```{r dpi=400, out.width="50%", fig.align="center", fig.cap="Neighborhoods of Top Out-Degree Nodes", echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
# include_graphics("./images/out_top_nodes.png")
```
